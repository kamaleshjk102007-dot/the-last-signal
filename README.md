# 📡 The Last Signal

> *A browser-based survival horror text experience.*

---

## Overview

**The Last Signal** is an atmospheric survival horror game played entirely in the browser. You are the sole survivor of Bunker B — a classified underground facility in Sector 7. Something breached the perimeter three days ago. The crew is gone. Power is failing. You don't know what it is, only that it hunts by sound and movement, and it is still inside with you.

Your objective: reach the communications array, boost the signal to **100%**, and transmit before power runs out.

## Gameplay

Manage four vital stats as you navigate the bunker:

- **Health** — take damage from the entity or environmental hazards
- **Power** — every action costs power; it does not regenerate
- **Sanity** — deteriorates as tension mounts
- **Signal** — boost it to 100% to win

Available actions each turn include searching rooms, moving between exits, barricading doors, healing, listening for threats, boosting the signal, hiding, and creating distractions. Choose wisely — power is finite, and when it runs out, the bunker seals.

## The Threat

**IT** — designation unknown. Does not respond to light. Attracted to noise and movement. Becomes increasingly aggressive as power fails. Has not left the bunker.
